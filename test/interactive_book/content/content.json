On average, a strawberry has about 200 seeds on its external membrane.&nbsp;Some vary in foliage, and some vary materially in the relative development of their sexual organs. In most cases, the flowers appear hermaphroditic in structure, but function as either male or female.&nbsp;For purposes of commercial production, plants are propagated from runners and, in general, distributed as either bare root plants or plugs. Cultivation follows one of two general models\u2014annual plasticulture,&nbsp;or a perennial system of matted rows or mounds.&nbsp;Greenhouses produce a small amount of strawberries during the off season.<\/p>\n\n<p>The bulk of modern commercial production uses the plasticulture system. In this method, raised beds are formed each year,&nbsp;fumigated, and covered with plastic to prevent weed growth and erosion. Plants, usually obtained from northern nurseries, are planted through holes punched in this covering, and irrigation tubing is run underneath. Runners are removed from the plants as they appear, in order to encourage the plants to put most of their energy into fruit development. At the end of the harvest season, the plastic is removed and the plants are plowed into the ground.<\/p>\n\n<p>Because strawberry plants more than a year or two old begin to decline in productivity and fruit quality, this system of replacing the plants each year allows for improved yields and denser plantings.&nbsp;However, because it requires a longer growing season to allow for establishment of the plants each year, and because of the increased costs in terms of forming and covering the mounds and purchasing plants each year, it is not always practical in all areas.<\/p>\n\n<p>The other major method, which uses the same plants from year to year growing in rows or on mounds, is most common in colder climates.&nbsp;It has lower investment costs, and lower overall maintenance requirements.&nbsp;Yields are typically lower than in plasticulture.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another method uses a compost sock. Plants grown in compost socks have been shown to produce significantly higher oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC),&nbsp;flavonoids,&nbsp;anthocyanins,&nbsp;fructose,&nbsp;glucose,&nbsp;sucrose,&nbsp;malic acid, and citric acid than fruit produced in the black plastic mulch or matted row systems.&nbsp;Similar results in an earlier 2003 study conducted by the US Dept of Agriculture, at the Agricultural Research Service, in Beltsville Maryland, confirms how compost plays a role in the bioactive qualities of two strawberry cultivars.<\/p>\n\n<p>Strawberries are often grouped according to their flowering habit. Traditionally, this has consisted of a division between \"June-bearing\" strawberries, which bear their fruit in the early summer and \"ever-bearing\" strawberries, which often bear several crops of fruit throughout the season.&nbsp;One plant throughout a season may produce 50 to 60 times or roughly once every three days.<\/p>\n\n<p>Research published in 2001 showed that strawberries actually occur in three basic flowering habits: short-day, long-day, and day-neutral. These refer to the day-length sensitivity of the plant and the type of photoperiod that induces flower formation. Day-neutral cultivars produce flowers regardless of the photoperiod.<\/p>\n\n<p>Strawberries may also be propagated by seed, though this is primarily a hobby activity, and is not widely practiced commercially. A few seed-propagated cultivars have been developed for home use, and research into growing from seed commercially is ongoing.&nbsp;Seeds (achenes) are acquired either via commercial seed suppliers, or by collecting and saving them from the fruit.<\/p>\n\n<p>Strawberries can also be grown indoors in strawberry pots.&nbsp;Although the plant may not naturally grow indoors in the winter, use of LED lighting in combination of blue and red light can allow the plant to grow during the winter.&nbsp;Additionally, in certain areas like the state of Florida, winter is the natural growing season where harvesting starts in mid-November.<\/p>\n\n<p>In continental Europe, particularly in Ukraine, strawberry harvesting in hoophouses is widespread.<\/p>\n\n<h3>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n<h3>Manuring and harvesting<\/h3>\n\n<p>A diorama created from beeswax by Dr. Henry Brainerd Wright at the Louisiana State Exhibit Museum in Shreveport, Louisiana, depicts strawberry harvesting. Strawberries are particularly grown in the southeastern portion of the state around Hammond.<\/p>\n\n<p>Most strawberry plants are now fed with artificial fertilizers, both before and after harvesting, and often before planting in plasticulture.<\/p>\n\n<p>To maintain top quality, berries are harvested at least every other day. The berries are picked with the caps still attached and with at least half an inch of stem left. Strawberries need to remain on the plant to fully ripen because they do not continue to ripen after being picked. Rotted and overripe berries are removed to minimize insect and disease problems. The berries do not get washed until just before consumption.<\/p>\n\n<p>Strawberries are usually picked and placed in shallow boxes in the field.<br>\nSoil test information and plant analysis results are used to determine fertility practices. Nitrogen fertilizer is needed at the beginning of every planting year. There are normally adequate levels of phosphorus and potash when fields have been fertilized for top yields. In order to provide more organic matter, a cover crop of wheat or rye is planted in the winter before planting the strawberries. Strawberries prefer a pH from 5.5 to 6.5, so lime is usually not applied.<\/p>\n\n<p>The harvesting and cleaning process has not changed substantially over time. The delicate strawberries are still harvested by hand.&nbsp;Grading and packing often occurs in the field, rather than in a processing facility.&nbsp;In large operations, strawberries are cleaned by means of water streams and shaking conveyor belts.<\/p>\n\n<h3>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n<h3>Diseases<\/h3>\n\n<p>Strawberry plants can fall victim to a number of diseases, especially when subjected to stress.&nbsp;The leaves may be infected by powdery mildew,&nbsp;leaf spot (caused by the fungus Sphaerella fragariae),&nbsp;leaf blight (caused by the fungus Phomopsis obscurans), and by a variety of slime molds.&nbsp;The crown and roots may fall victim to red stele,&nbsp;verticillium wilt,&nbsp;black root rot, and nematodes.&nbsp;The fruits are subject to damage from gray mold,&nbsp;rhizopus rot, and leather rot.&nbsp;To prevent root-rotting, strawberries should be planted every four to five years in a new bed, at a different site.<\/p>\n\n<p>The plants can also develop disease from temperature extremes during winter.&nbsp;When watering strawberries, advice has been given to water only the roots and not the leaves, as moisture on the leaves encourages growth of fungus.<\/p>\n\n<h3>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n<h3>Domestic cultivation<\/h3>\n\n<p>Strawberries are popular and rewarding plants to grow in the domestic environment, be it for consumption or exhibition purposes, almost anywhere in the world. The best time to plant is in late summer or spring. Plant in full sun or dappled shade, and in somewhat sandy soil. The addition of manure and a balanced fertilizer aids strong growth. Alternatively they can be planted in pots or special planters using compost. Fibre mats placed under each plant will protect fruits from touching the ground, and will act as a weed barrier.<\/p>\n\n<p>Strawberries are tough and will survive many conditions, but during fruit formation, moisture is vital, especially if growing in containers. Moreover, protection must be provided against slugs and snails which attack the ripe fruit. The fruit matures in midsummer (wild varieties can mature earlier) and should be picked when fully ripe \u2014 that is, the fruit is a uniform bright red colour. The selection of different varieties can extend the season in both directions.<\/p>\n"},"library":"H5P.Text 1.1","metadata":{"contentType":"Text","license":"U","title":"Untitled Text"},"subContentId":"3d55f1d0-de8c-44c9-9460-66512e5806f0"}],"header":"Cultivation"},{"position":{"x":78.414839797639,"y":48.384858086881},"alwaysFullscreen":false,"content":[{"params":{"text":"<p>The very first garden strawberry was grown in Brittany,&nbsp;France, during the late 18th century.&nbsp;Prior to this,&nbsp;wild strawberries and cultivated selections from wild strawberry species were the common source of the fruit.<\/p>\n\n<p>The strawberry fruit was mentioned in ancient Roman literature in reference to its medicinal use. The French began taking the strawberry from the forest to their gardens for harvest in the 14th century.&nbsp;Charles V, France's king from 1364 to 1380, had 1,200 strawberry plants in his royal garden. In the early 15th century western European monks were using the wild strawberry in their illuminated manuscripts. The strawberry is found in Italian, Flemish, and German art, and in English miniatures.&nbsp;The entire strawberry plant was used to treat depressive illnesses.<\/p>\n\n<p>By the 16th century, references of cultivation of the strawberry became more common. People began using it for its supposed medicinal properties and botanists began naming the different species. In England the demand for regular strawberry farming had increased by the mid-16th century.<\/p>\n\n<p>The combination of strawberries and cream was created by Thomas Wolsey in the court of King Henry VIII.&nbsp;Instructions for growing and harvesting strawberries showed up in writing in 1578. By the end of the 16th century three European species had been cited:&nbsp;F. vesca,&nbsp;F. moschata, and F. viridis. The garden strawberry was transplanted from the forests and then the plants would be propagated asexually by cutting off the runners.<\/p>\n\n<p>Two subspecies of F. vesca were identified:&nbsp;F. sylvestris alba and F. sylvestris semperflorens. The introduction of F. virginiana from Eastern North America to Europe in the 17th century is an important part of history because this species gave rise to the modern strawberry. The new species gradually spread through the continent and did not become completely appreciated until the end of the 18th century. When a French excursion journeyed to Chile in 1712, it introduced the North American strawberry plant with female flowers that resulted in the common strawberry that we have today.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Mapuche and Huilliche Indians of Chile cultivated the female strawberry species until 1551, when the Spanish came to conquer the land. In 1765, a European explorer recorded the cultivation of F. chiloensis, the Chilean strawberry. At first introduction to Europe, the plants grew vigorously but produced no fruit. It was discovered in 1766 that the female plants could only be pollinated by plants that produced large fruit:&nbsp;F. moschata,&nbsp;F. virginiana, and F. ananassa. This is when the Europeans became aware that plants had the ability to produce male-only or female-only flowers. As more large-fruit producing plants were cultivated the Chilean strawberry slowly decreased in population in Europe, except for around Brest where the Chilean strawberry thrived. The decline of the Chilean strawberry was caused by F. ananassa.<\/p>\n"},"library":"H5P.Text 1.1","metadata":{"contentType":"Text","license":"U","title":"Untitled Text"},"subContentId":"877d0be7-c2f2-4b6a-ac82-0b379907583b"}],"header":"History"},{"position":{"x":34.738617200675,"y":80.178679940554},"alwaysFullscreen":false,"content":[{"params":{"text":"<h3>Strawberries and cream<\/h3>\n\n<p>In addition to being consumed fresh, strawberries can be frozen or made into jam or preserves,&nbsp;as well as dried and used in prepared foods, such as cereal bars.&nbsp;Strawberries and strawberry flavorings are a popular addition to dairy products, such as strawberry milk,&nbsp;strawberry ice cream,&nbsp;strawberry milkshakes\/smoothies and strawberry yogurts.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the United Kingdom, \"strawberries and cream\" is a popular dessert consumed at the Wimbledon tennis tournament.&nbsp;Strawberries and cream is also a staple snack in Mexico, usually available at ice cream parlors.

A specialized production system called \"long cane production\" involves growing canes for a year in a northern climate such as Scotland or Oregon or Washington, where the chilling requirement for proper bud break is attained, or attained earlier than the ultimate place of planting. These canes are then dug, roots and all, to be replanted in warmer climates such as Spain, where they quickly flower and produce a very early season crop. Plants are typically planted 2-6 per m in fertile, well drained soil; raspberries are usually planted in raised beds\/ridges, if there is any question about root rot problems.<\/p>\n\n<p>All cultivars of raspberries have perennial roots but, many do not have perennial shoots. In fact, most raspberries have shoots that are biennial (meaning shoots grow in the first growing season and fruits grow off of those shoots during the second growing season).&nbsp;The flowers can be a major nectar source for honeybees and other pollinators.<\/p>\n\n<p>Raspberries are vigorous and can be locally invasive. They propagate using basal shoots (also known as suckers), extended underground shoots that develop roots and individual plants. They can sucker new canes some distance from the main plant. For this reason, raspberries spread well, and can take over gardens if left unchecked. Raspberries are often propagated using cuttings, and will root readily in moist soil conditions.<\/p>\n\n<p>The fruit is harvested when it comes off the receptacle easily and has turned a deep color (red, black, purple, or golden yellow, depending on the species and cultivar). This is when the fruits are ripest and sweetest.<\/p>\n\n<p>High tunnel bramble production offers the opportunity to bridge gaps in availability during late fall and late spring. Furthermore, high tunnels allow less hardy floricane-fruiting raspberries to overwinter in climates where they wouldn't otherwise survive. In the tunnel plants are established at close spacing usually prior to tunnel construction.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n"},"metadata":{"contentType":"Text","license":"CC BY-SA","title":"Wikipedia: Raspberries article","authors":[{"name":"Wikipedia","role":"Author"}],"licenseVersion":"3.0","source":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Raspberry"},"subContentId":"03dd8e7b-eea9-4ea7-b776-cfd8394c491f"},"useSeparator":"auto"},{"content":{"library":"H5P.Blanks 1.12","params":{"questions":["<p>Raspberries support those with Type-2 *diabetes* by activating the production of adiponectin, which balances blood *sugar*.

In North America, the most common cultivated species is V. corymbosum, the northern highbush blueberry. Hybrids of this with other Vaccinium species adapted to southern U.S. climates are known collectively as southern highbush blueberries.<\/p>\n\n<p>So-called \"wild\" (lowbush) blueberries, smaller than cultivated highbush ones, have intense color. The lowbush blueberry,&nbsp;V. angustifolium, is found from the Atlantic provinces westward to Quebec and southward to Michigan and West Virginia. In some areas, it produces natural \"blueberry barrens\", where it is the dominant species covering large areas. Several First Nations communities in Ontario are involved in harvesting wild blueberries.<\/p>\n\n<p>\"Wild\" has been adopted as a marketing term for harvests of managed native stands of lowbush blueberries. The bushes are not planted or genetically manipulated, but they are pruned or burned over every two years, and pests are \"managed\".<\/p>\n\n<p>Numerous highbush cultivars of blueberries are available, with diversity among them, each having individual qualities. A blueberry breeding program has been established by the USDA-ARS breeding program at Beltsville, Maryland, and Chatsworth, New Jersey. This program began when Frederick Vernon Coville of the USDA-ARS collaborated with Elizabeth Coleman White of New Jersey.&nbsp;In the early part of the 20th century, White offered pineland residents cash for wild blueberry plants with unusually large fruit.&nbsp;After 1910 Coville began to work on blueberry, and was the first to discover the importance of soil acidity (blueberries need highly acidic soil), that blueberries do not self-pollinate, and the effects of cold on blueberries and other plants.&nbsp;In 1911, he began a program of research in conjunction with White, daughter of the owner of the extensive cranberry bogs at Whitesbog in the New Jersey Pine Barrens. His work doubled the size of some strains' fruit, and by 1916, he had succeeded in cultivating blueberries, making them a valuable crop in the Northeastern United States.&nbsp;For this work he received the George Roberts White Medal of Honor from the Massachusetts Horticultural Society.<\/p>\n\n<p>The rabbiteye blueberry (Vaccinium virgatum syn.&nbsp;V. ashei) is a southern type of blueberry produced from the Carolinas to the Gulf Coast states. Production of rabbiteye blueberries was a focus in Texas in the early 21st century.&nbsp;Other important species in North America include V. pallidum, the hillside or dryland blueberry. It is native to the eastern U.S., and common in the Appalachians and the Piedmont of the Southeast. Sparkleberry,&nbsp;V. arboreum, is a common wild species on sandy soils in the Southeast.<\/p>\n\n<p>Successful blueberry cultivation requires attention to soil pH (acidity) measurements in the acidic range.<\/p>\n\n<p>Blueberry bushes often require supplemental fertilization,&nbsp;but over-fertilization with nitrogen can damage plant health, as evidenced by nitrogen-burn visible on the leaves.<\/p>\n"},"library":"H5P.Text 1.1","metadata":{"contentType":"Text","license":"U","title":"Untitled Text"},"subContentId":"1b46a946-1714-4bc4-8fbf-71dd8b13d422"}],"header":"Cultivation"},{"position":{"x":77.234401349073,"y":48.032175253561},"alwaysFullscreen":false,"content":[{"params":{"text":"<h3>Origin and history of cultivation<\/h3>\n\n<p>The genus Vaccinium has a mostly circumpolar distribution, with species mainly present in North America,&nbsp;Europe, and Asia.&nbsp;Many commercially sold species with English common names including \"blueberry\" are from North America, particularly Atlantic Canada and Northeastern United States for wild (lowbush) blueberries, and several US states and British Columbia for cultivated (highbush) blueberries.&nbsp;Canada's First Nations people consumed wild blueberries for centuries before North America was settled.&nbsp;Highbush blueberries were first cultivated in New Jersey around the beginning of the 20th century.<\/p>\n\n<p>North American native species of blueberries are grown commercially in the Southern Hemisphere in Australia, New Zealand and South American nations.
